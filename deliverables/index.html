</table><h2>Deliverables and Tasks</h2>
<h3>Product Requirements Document (PRD):</h3>
<p>After firming up the project idea, each team will be required to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document">Product Requirements Document (PRD)</a> that details all the various aspects of the project. It is written to allow stakeholders to understand what a product should do, and also serves as a guiding document for the team that is building the product.</p>
<p>The PRD should include a one paragraph summary of the project (summarize your project proposal), vertical slice (what are you going to deliver at the end of the quarter), the three core features along with their feasibility and metrics of completion, materials and outside help needed, budget, risks, and how risks will be addressed. Your PRD will be used to evaluate your progress throughout the rest of the course.</p>
<p>PRD template: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UDVjfZUorkVGf-bIQZLe6fD4SvolOGA2mj_jY-iiuD8/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNsYpxXnk1XpDINh36oyUXWpBQa983ueafEXNHuBrdo/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<h3>Feature Proof of Concepts</h3>
<p>At the end of the first week of the sprint each team will meet with the course staff during class time to provide updates on progress and show a proof of concept for the target feature.</p>

<p>During this first week of the sprint each team is required to try generating solutions for the feature from an LLM and sharing the results with the course staff, although it is not required to build off these results for the rest of the sprint.</p>

<p>Each team will also provide a report in the weekly updates document. The report must include the LLM results and the status of the tasks for each team member (completed, in-progress, blocked) with accompanying images, videos, or code snippets. The report must also include the tasks for each team member to complete the sprint.</p>

<p>Evaluation of the proof of concept stage will be conducted per team member based on the work completed and demonstrated through accompanying documentation.</p>

<h3>Feature Demos</h3>
<p>During the final class session of each feature sprint each team will provide a demo of their feature to other students in the class and the course staff. The demo does not need to be incorporated into the vertical slice and can focus only on the functionality of the single feature.</p>

<p>Each team will also need to prepare a user testing plan to collect feedback during this session, which can be in the form of interviews, questionnaires, structured observations, or other methods determined to provide actionable information.</p>

<p>Evaluation of the demonstration will be based on the metrics of completion defined in the PRD and overall quality (i.e free of errors unique to the feature).</p>

<h3>Team Tutorial</h3>
<p>In the middle of the quarter each team will prepare a tutorial to be given to the rest of the class about one of the features from their project. Each team will have 20 minutes to present their tutorial and can also prepare a prerequisite document for what the class will need ready before the session.</p>

<p>Everyone on the team is expected to be involved in the tutorial either through preparing the materials, templates, or presenting. The tutorial must include a hands-on component for the rest of the class to follow along.</p>

<h3>Vertical Slice Demo Video</h3>
<p>Create a video that presents what the application should accomplish (or what challenge it is trying to solve), the capabilities of the application and an example of how it is played or used. The videos are going to be played during the demo session and uploaded to the UW Reality Lab YouTube account. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUrnEzq_q60&list=PL8bmgwX9eBPGjM7NuYWPFbXIGKenRAg4Y">Examples of past videos</a>. The videos can be approximately 1 minute long. Can include narration (kickstarter style) or just demonstrate technical features of the project.</p>

<h3>Demo Plan and Rehersal</h3>
<p>Each team will be required to come up with a demo plan, that includes the floor-plan layout for the space, any furniture/props and some signage for the team project. Each team will also need to prepare a demo 'script' and rehearse the script in the Lab, a week prior to the final demo day.</p>

<h3>Demo Day</h3>
<p>The final demo day will take place on campus during finals week, date and time TBD. There will be a rehearsal, one week prior. More details will be sent later in the quarter as they are confirmed.</p>
<p>It will be very exciting, fun, and a fitting end to the capstone! It will be open to friends, family and general public. We will also invite a number of guests from companies like Microsoft, Magic Leap, Google, Meta, Valve, and more!</p>

<h3>Final Vertical Slice</h3>
<p>At the end of the course each team will present a vertical slice of their application incorporating their three features into a coherent experience. The vertical slice should demonstrate a vision of what the completed final product would be with a level of polish similar to the entire application.</p>

<p>Staff will evaluate final vertical slices on complexity, refinement, wholistic user experience, and final demo presentation.</p>

<h3>After the Capstone Ends</h3>
<p>Course related obligations end after demo day. However, some teams may choose to continue working on their capstone project in order to release it on the App Store, Open Source, etc. This is a great way to get your creations out into the world and gain recognition for your work! If your team would like to continue working on the project, please contact the course staff and we will be happy to help you!</p>
